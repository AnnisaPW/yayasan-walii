            Afforestation, reforestation, and revegetation activities are
            crucial to tackling climate change because they remove carbon while
            also restoring degraded ecosystems and improving soil conditions.
            ARR has natural challenges which include wildfires, drought and
            disease, which can lead to ultimately the reversal of carbon
            sequestration. Ultimately these are factors which must be considered
            when purchasing credits from the projects. We work with a variety of
            project developers in securing access to quality ARR projects. They
            are typically hard to source due to the high demand from larger
            buyers who secure access to these projects by purchasing large
            volumes over set time period.
